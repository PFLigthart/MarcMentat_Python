# MarcMentat_Python
Code to run finite element analysis in MarcMentat using python scripts. This allows for an optimisation loop to be setup with a finite element analysis within the loop.

## Contents
Instructions for how to setup a conda virtual environment in windows and to add the required libraries is provided.
Instructions for how to setup a python script that can interface with MarcMentat is provided.
Instructions for how to run the python script from the conda prompt (terminal) is is also provided.

My personal files used for my masters thesis are included and can be used as an example. A short discription of what my code is designed for is also provided.

## How to setup the conda virtual environment and add the required libraries.
The libraries required cannot be installed using either Pip or Conda. These libraries are part of the propriatary software and hence need to be copied into the virtual environment.
I use [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to setup my virtual environements.It is "[a small, bootstrap version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)][docs.conda.io]".
